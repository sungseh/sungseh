[comment]: <>I have a passion for building databases and have been doing it for a while mostly with Oracle tools. In recent times, Im looking to up skill to
focus mainly on Back-End & API technologies sprinkling a bit of front-end too. I believe a combination of that and my great SQL skills will be flames ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ for my skillset. The aim is to have a lot of work with skills Im learning and the ones i already have. 

I also have skills in project/task management building with ClickUp. I have a youtube videos showing tutorials on how to understand & use it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRC7Imvufi0).
